The QSS Crumb Chaser was dispatched to investigate unusual bread-like energy signatures emanating from the Bermuda Nebula — the same region where the Phantom Wing vanished. Contact was lost 72 hours after entering the nebula.

Lieutenant Smew Jr., son of the retired Commander Smew, volunteered for the mission despite warnings. A rescue mission is being planned, though fleet command considers the Bermuda Nebula too dangerous for further expeditions.
