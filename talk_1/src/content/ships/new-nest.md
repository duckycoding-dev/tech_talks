The CSS New Nest was the first colony ship to successfully establish a permanent settlement outside the home system. Her 1,500 colonists founded Puddle Prime, now a thriving world with its own orbital shipyard.

Governor Shelduck oversees both the ship and the colony, maintaining the New Nest in orbit as emergency housing and a trade hub. The ship's bio-dome has been converted into the system's largest open-air market.
