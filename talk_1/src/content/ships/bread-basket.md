The HSS Bread Basket is the largest cargo vessel in the supply fleet, capable of carrying enough provisions to feed three colony worlds for a full season. Her massive hold is climate-controlled to keep bread at optimal freshness across interstellar distances.

Skipper Gadwall runs the most efficient supply route in the fleet, affectionately known as "The Bread Run" — a 12-stop circuit through the inner colonies.
