The HSS Starling Express was the longest-serving freighter in fleet history, completing over 500 supply runs across a decade of faithful service. Her hull bore the scars of a hundred micro-meteorite impacts, each one patched with a different alloy, giving her a distinctive patchwork appearance.

Old Salt Merganser refused to let anyone else captain her, flying every single one of those 500 runs personally. When the Express was finally retired, he reportedly shed a single tear — the only known instance of a duck captain doing so.
