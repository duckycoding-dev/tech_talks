The QSS Quackstar is the pride of the Space Duck Exploratory Fleet. Launched from Pond Zero's orbital drydock, she was the first vessel to chart the Breadcrumb Nebula. Her crew discovered three habitable moons, each with vast freshwater lakes — ideal for future duck colonies.

The Quackstar's advanced sensor array can detect bread crumbs at a range of 12 parsecs, making her invaluable for deep space scouting missions.
