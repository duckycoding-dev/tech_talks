The HSS Migrator is the workhorse of the Space Duck supply chain. What she lacks in speed and armament, she makes up for in cargo capacity — her hold can transport enough pond weed to sustain an entire colony for a full migration cycle.

Captain Teal runs a tight ship with minimal crew, preferring efficiency over ceremony. The Migrator has completed over 200 supply runs without a single lost shipment.
