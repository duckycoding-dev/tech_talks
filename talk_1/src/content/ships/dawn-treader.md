The QSS Dawn Treader specializes in charting uncharted nebulae at the edges of known space. Her probe launchers can deploy up to 40 autonomous survey drones simultaneously, mapping entire star systems while the crew enjoys their afternoon bread ration.

Navigator Wigeon earned her commission after discovering the Crumb Corridor, a safe passage through the Toaster Nebula that cut travel times by three weeks.
