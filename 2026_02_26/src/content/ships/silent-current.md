The DSS Silent Current served as the fleet's primary electronic warfare vessel for eight years. Her ECM suite could jam enemy communications across an entire star system, earning her the nickname "The Silencer."

After a reactor leak during a routine patrol, she was safely towed back to Fort Waddle and decommissioned. Commander Smew retired alongside his ship and now teaches tactics at the Naval Academy.
