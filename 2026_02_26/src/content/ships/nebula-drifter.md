The RSS Nebula Drifter is the newest addition to the Science Division, purpose-built for long-duration atmospheric studies inside gas giants and nebulae. Her reinforced hull can withstand pressures that would crush a standard vessel.

Dr. Garganey's first mission aboard the Drifter yielded extraordinary results: the discovery of complex organic molecules inside the Breadcrumb Nebula that may explain the origin of space bread — a mystery that has puzzled duck scientists for generations.
