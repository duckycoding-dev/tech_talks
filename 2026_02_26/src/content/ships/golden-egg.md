The CSS Golden Egg will be the largest vessel ever constructed by the Space Duck Collective. Designed to carry an entire colony of 2,000 ducks to the newly discovered Puddle System, she represents the next chapter of duck civilization.

Currently under construction at the Pond Zero Megadock, the Golden Egg's bio-dome will feature artificial lakes, hydroponic bread gardens, and a full-scale weather simulation system. Launch is scheduled for late 2026.
