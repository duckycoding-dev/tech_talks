The DSS Iron Feather is the most heavily armed vessel in the Space Duck fleet. Her triple-layered feather-weave hull can withstand direct hits from most known weapons systems. Admiral Eiderdown has commanded the ship through fourteen successful engagements.

Her Bread Crumb Mines are a feared deterrent — once deployed, they attract hostile wildlife while the Iron Feather slips away to a tactical advantage.
