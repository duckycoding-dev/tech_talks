The RSS Bill Nye served the Space Duck Science Division for nearly a decade, mapping gravitational anomalies and cataloguing over 4,000 new species of space algae. Her onboard laboratory was considered the finest in the fleet.

After her final mission studying the Great Puddle Rift, she was decommissioned with full honors. Her hull now serves as a museum orbiting Lake Nexus, where young ducklings can learn about the wonders of space exploration.
