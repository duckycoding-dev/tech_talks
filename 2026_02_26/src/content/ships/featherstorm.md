The DSS Featherstorm is the newest warship in the combat fleet, featuring fourth-generation feather-weave armor and an experimental railgun array that can punch through asteroid belts. She completed her shakedown cruise with a flawless record.

Captain Scoter is known for running the tightest drills in the fleet. The Featherstorm's crew holds the record for fastest battle-stations readiness at 47 seconds flat.
