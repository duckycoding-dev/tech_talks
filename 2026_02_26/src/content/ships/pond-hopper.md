The RSS Pond Hopper is a mobile research laboratory dedicated to xenobiology. Her sample collectors can gather water, soil, and atmospheric specimens from a planet's surface without ever landing, using long-range transporter beams.

Professor Pochard's team recently published groundbreaking research on space algae photosynthesis, proving that certain strains can convert starlight into bread-compatible nutrients.
