The CSS Waddle Star will be the most ambitious colony ship ever conceived — a generation ship designed to carry 3,000 ducks on a multi-year voyage to the distant Lagoon Cluster. Her design incorporates lessons learned from every previous colony mission.

Still in the early construction phase at Pond Zero Megadock, the Waddle Star's keel was laid in a ceremony attended by the entire Admiralty. She features three interconnected bio-domes, each simulating a different climate zone to ensure the colonists feel right at home.
