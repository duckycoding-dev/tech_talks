The DSS Phantom Wing vanished during a routine patrol near the Bermuda Nebula in late 2025. Equipped with an experimental cloaking device, she was the stealthiest ship in the fleet — which makes her disappearance all the more unsettling.

Search parties have found no wreckage, no distress signals, and no trace of her 210 crew members. Some believe she slipped into a parallel dimension. Others whisper that Captain Ghost Feather went rogue. The truth remains unknown.
